This is the redditmedia.com website that I created back in 2007. It was pretty
popular among redditors, until reddit got pics and videos subreddit.

You can see how it looked like at http://reddit.picurls.com

It was created by Peteris Krumins (peter@catonmat.net).
His blog is at http://www.catonmat.net  --  good coders code, great reuse

This is a complete package which generates redditmedia.com
website.

Each directory except /templates and /scripts contains a readme
with basic description of what the dir was made for.

/templates directory contains HTML template fragments which
Perl's Template::Toolkit puts together to create pages seen on
http://redditmedia.com

/scripts directory contains all the Perl scripts and modules
which do all the generation and data mining together.

See the article on how it was designed for for much more detailed information:
